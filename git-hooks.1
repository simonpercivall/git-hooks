.SH LOCATIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B git\-hooks provide a way to manage and share your hooks by allowing for the installation of hooks in three locations:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
User hooks that are installed in ~/.githooks/
.IP \(bu 2
Project hooks that are installed in the .githooks directory inside of each project.
.IP \(bu 2
Global hooks that are specified with the hooks.global configuration option
.sp
Multiple global hooks directories can be specified by using a space between each path.
.UNINDENT

.B The contrib directory includes a number of useful hooks and can be set by doing the following:
> git config \-\-global hooks.global $PWD/contrib/
.UNINDENT
.SH CREATING HOOKS
.sp
To keep things organized git\-hooks looks for scripts in sub directories named after the git hook name.  For example this project has the following pre\-commit script in the following location:
.sp
githooks/pre\-commit/bsd
.sp
When you run \(aqgit hooks\(aq with no arguments it will list all of the hooks installed on the system.  It will run the hooks with the \-\-about argument to generate the description that is shown.  Checkout the hooks in contrib for some examples.
